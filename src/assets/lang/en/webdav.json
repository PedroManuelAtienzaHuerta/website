        "question": "Is WebDAV secure?",
        "answer": "Yes. When enabled, the WebDAV feature uses a local-only server on your machine, thanks to our CLI. We implement the same zero-knowledge and end-to-end encryption methods to guarantee the privacy and security of your files."

        "question": "Do I need to worry about self-signed certificates?",
        "answer": "Internxt uses self-signed certificates for the WebDAV local server. While some WebDAV clients might raise a warning about these certificates, they are safe to ignore. The encryption protects your data regardless."
